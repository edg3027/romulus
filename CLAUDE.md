## Development Workflow

- After making any changes, always run:
  1. Lint: `pnpm lint` to check for type errors and code style issues
  2. Unit tests: `pnpm test:unit <path>` to run tests for the modified files or `pnpm test` for all tests
- Fix any lint errors or failing tests before considering the changes complete
